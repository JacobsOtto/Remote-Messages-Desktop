# [Remote Messages](http://www.remotemessages.com/) For Desktop

_Not Affliated with [Beast Soft](http://www.beastsoft.co.uk/)_

My main reason for developing this is so that I don't need to have a Chrome tab open to use the service.

## Current Status: Alpha - v0.1.0

## Features

* Close to System Tray
* Notification Support
* Completely Working Remote Messages Service
