# [Remote Messages](http://www.remotemessages.com/) For Desktop

_Not Affliated with [Beast Soft](http://www.beastsoft.co.uk/)_

My main reason for developing this is so that I don't need to have a Chrome tab open to use the service.

#### Note: Remote Messages is only available for Jailbroken iPhones. Please see their [FAQ](http://www.remotemessages.com/faqs/) for further details.
